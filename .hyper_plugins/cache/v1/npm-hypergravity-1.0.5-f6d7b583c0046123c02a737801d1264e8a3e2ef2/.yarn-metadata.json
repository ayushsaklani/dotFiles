Open `~/.hyper.js` and add `hypergravity` in the proper place:\n```js\n  plugins: [\n    // some other plugins\n    'hypergravity'\n  ],\n```\n2. Run Hyper and press `Command + G` (or `Control + G` on Linux and Windows) to toggle gravity mode!\n\n## How to run it for development\n\n1. Clone the repo to `~/.hyper_plugins/local/hypergravity`\n2. Go to `hypergravity` folder.\n3. Run `yarn` to install the dependencies.\n4. Add this to your `.hyper.js`:\n```js\n  localPlugins: [\n    // maybe some other local plugins\n    'hypergravity'\n  ],\n```\n5. At the beginning and after each change in source files, run `yarn build` to (re)build `index.js` which is in fact loaded by Hyper.\n",
