It automatically will open on the screen where your mouse is.\n\n```js\nmodules.exports = {\n  config: {\n    // other config...\n    visor: {\n      hotkey: 'CommandOrControl+Shift+Z',\n      position: 'top', // or left, right, bottom\n      width: 200, // Optional, defaults to half of viewable area for horizontal positions, 100% for vertical\n      height: 900, // Optional, defaults to half of viewable area for vertical positions, 100% for horizontal\n    },\n  },\n  // ...\n};\n```\n\nYou can define hotkeys as specified in the [Electron Accelerator docs](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/accelerator.md).\n\n## Roadmap\n\n* Better customization of where you can make the terminal appear.\n* Option to always open on a specific monitor, etc.\n* Double press mod keys to activate (i.e. hit Ctrl twice to activate).\n* Create window if all windows have been closed.\n\n## Caveats\n\n* It always uses the most recently open window as your visor window.\n* If all windows have been closed, it won't do anything until you manually open a new window.\n\nThis is pretty basic in its current form, and I'm labeling it as a beta as I use it and patch up edge cases, etc. I will build out more functionality and beef up this README as we go. \n\n## Changelog\n\nStarting with version `0.3.0`, I have been documenting changes via GitHub's [release tab](https://github.com/CWSpear/hyperterm-visor/releases).\n",
